Chekov (now on Rails!)
============

A lightweight, Rails-backed web app for minor bug tracking and resolution.

Ideal for quick-turnaround projects, or for issues too minor to be added to a more comprehensive issue tracker,
or that can be disposed of in just one sitting, a few hours, or in one day.

A simplified interface requires only the most basic facts.  Just close the ticket and check it off!

(Original project was a Backbone single-page app, backed by Laravel 3. Domain models and behavior ported over from there.)
